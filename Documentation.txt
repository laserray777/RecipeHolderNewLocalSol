[This is a local only RecipeHolderNewLocalSol solution, with
the purpose of quickly copying the RecipeHolder project from
F:\...\import of vs\...\RecipeHolder, and establishing a working
Git configuration for the complete project, with all important
files staged and committed and existing in the .git repository.
I will then push this complete project to an appropriate VSTS
remote and clone that remote repository on DESKTOP-RASK4QR.
I will then be able to work on this project, anytime and anywhere
I have an internet connection. There was an practically hopeless
merge conflict on the regular RecipeHolder projects which
prevented me from pushing them to a remote from which to clone.]
